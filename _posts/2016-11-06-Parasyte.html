<h3>Task: Design a collector for the balls</h3>
<p>
     We've spent the last few practies creating a ball collector. The idea was to have our track with the gripping rubber bands
	 reach from the bottom of the robot to our 3D designed ramp. The path would guide the balls to a higher position on our robot to
	 the launching mechanism. We needed to adjust the correct orientation of the support beams guiding the balls, needing to drill new
	 holes and adjust beam lengths. 
</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
There have been a lot of adjustments we have had to made to the this tread-based system. Starting from an eyeball test of the length,
we had to eventuall lengthen the whole tread to fit the whole system. With our length being about finalized, and our entire path about done,
We are about ready to attach our launching mechanism and start adjusting the scoring mechanism.
