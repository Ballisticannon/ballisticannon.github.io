<h3>Task: Create a video outlining Iron Reign's outreach</h3>

     We have had a lot of interest garnered towards the STEM outreach the team has committed to. When we found that FTC encouraged the creation of a video outlining the 
	 STEM outreach we had done, we saw it as an opportunity to show others a general overview of our activities. So with my voiceover, we made a video
	 talking about how long the team's been at it, the various STEM expos/events we do, and how the problem of summer learning loss lead us to making the Mobile
	 Tech Xperience.

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
Making a connection and advancing our community has always been a priority with our team. This video helps give us a short summary to show parents and children the benefit
of commiting to the STEM field, specifically in robotics. We started because of two parents who decided to start a robotics team with some energetic middle school 7 years
back, and look at us now. We want to tell these interested parents and kids about how their dedication can create something special, and we're doing that by using
ourselves and FIRST as examples. We plan to spread this video to those looking to get into FIRST, or even those simply interested in what our team does besides
build complicated contraptions.
