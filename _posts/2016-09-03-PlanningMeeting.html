<h3>Task: </h3>
<p>
This week we met to discuss the origination of the meetings for the upcoming year. We decided that for the first fifteen minutes of the meeting we would outline our plans for the meeting. Then during our lunch break we would get together once again to discuss the progress that we have made and what we will move onto by the end of the meeting . By structuring our meetings we will be able accomplish more in the same amount of time and at the end of the season we will be able to better analyse our accomplishments. 

</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
Organization has always been a challenge for Iron Reign and we hope that by doing this we will be able to eliminate any periods of time during the meeting where people don't know what work they should do.
