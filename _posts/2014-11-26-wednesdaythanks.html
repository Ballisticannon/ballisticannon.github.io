<h4> Task: Construct vertical lift to elevate balls </h4>
<p>
The team had an extra meet during the ThanksGiving holidays and we used the ime to start building the lift system that will bring the balls up so we can deposit them in the
tubes. Here I am testing a prototype of that system which consists of a cardboard poster mailer with a 3D designed and printed tube joint that guides the lift strap. The strap is a soft closed-cell foam type of weather stripping that nicely presses the balls against the far side of the tube and provides enough friction so they don't fall back down. The weather stripping is sewn to polyester strapping that prevents it from stretching and also provides a low friction backing that allows the strap to slide up the tube. These were materials we found on various trips to home depot.
