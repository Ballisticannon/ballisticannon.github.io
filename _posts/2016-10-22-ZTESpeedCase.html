<h3>Task: Make a case for the ZTE Speed controlling the robot</h3>
<p>
    While we are still in the early stages of design and it's not wise to make a permanent
	decision about where the robot's controlling phone will be, we can't let it float freely
	around the robot like a brain in a jar for much longer or it'll start getting caught in
	the developing systems. Normally, we could solve this easily by drilling a few holes in
	an off-the-shelf phone case and bolting it to the robot, but both the robot's design and
	the phone's code are constantly changing, so this would be far too permanent. We decided
	that the best way to house the phone would be a custom-made case with plenty of bolt holes
	to make it easily mountable and removable as well as a front which can be taken off at any
	time so we can take out the phone to reprogram it without driving ourselves insane.
</p>
<p>
	I decided to make the case a pair of 3D-printed parts: a sturdy base made of t-glase which
	can be bolted to the robot and can easily socket the phone, and a flexible nylon cover
	plate which is kept in place by tabs which wrap around the base component but can be pulled
	out of the way when the phone needs to be put in or taken out.
</p>


<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
	It took a few iterations before we printed the pieces, but the system as a whole is working
	smoothly. The phone is easy to replace and so far we haven't seen the cover come off once
	while the robot was driving. The only forseeable issue is with the tabs. Although they are
	flexible enough for our purposes, they are thin enough that they can be broken if bent too
	far. Since the face plates don't take too long to print and the 3 tabs left over after one
	breaks are still entirely capable of holding the phone in anyways, this shouldn't be too
	much of an issue, but it's still something to keep in mind for the future.
