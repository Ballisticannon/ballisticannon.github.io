<h3>Task: Look at this thing because it's pretty neat</h3>

  <p>
	We recently went to the Nolan qualifier, and to help convince other teams to bring us into their alliances, we demonstrated the power of our lift mechanism by taking a video of it freeclimbing on a nearby basketball hoop. Evidently it was quite effective - we managed to convince the number 1 team to make us their first team pick.
