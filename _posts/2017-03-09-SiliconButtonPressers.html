<h3>Task: Make a replacement for the rubber eraser button pressers</h3>
<p>
	Since our last competition, we've decided that the erasers we've been using as button pressers don't really cut it. They deteriorate rather quickly from match to match and are a pain to replace, so a replacement is in order.
</p>
<p>
	We considered 3-D printing new button pressers, but most of the plastics we've used are too stiff; ABS and t-glase are completely out of the question, nylon is still to tough, and even Ninja Flex won't work because the pattern of the infill would still make the physical resistance inconsistent at different points along the edges of the piece.
