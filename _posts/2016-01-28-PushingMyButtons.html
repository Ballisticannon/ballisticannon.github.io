<h3>Task: To build a button-pusher for the beacon</h3>

<p>
     Today, we realized that the tape-measure attachment that's supposed to push the buttons on the beacon could have multiple functions instead  So, I designed an attachment to the tape measure that can push any buttons, including people's. I designed it in Creo and then printed it. We have yet to actually test it on the robot, but it works in the hand.
</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
	This is just our first design, and it has not been tested much. We feel that we should redesign the spikes to be deeper in the next version, and also not as densely packed. Further testing will reveal what the next step needs to be.
