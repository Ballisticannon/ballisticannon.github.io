<h3>Noteworthy Updates:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
	This may not be new info to me, but I think my math course this year, ATTAM (short for Application and Theory in Various Topics of Advanced Math), is worth explaining. Most high school seniors would likely be expected to be taking some AP math course while they apply for college, but at SEM, we tend to run into a problem with that notion: we're too good at math. Or at least, we do math too quickly. In SEM, we have three different "tracks" which students get sorted into ("Normal", "Fast", and "Super Fast"), according to their math capabilities. Members of the "Super Fast Track" (myself included) move through math courses at a blistering pace: we went through the entirety of Algebra 2, Geometry, and AP Calculus AB in freshman year alone. As we gain more influence over our schedules in the following years, some students choose to take a bit more leisurely of an approach to math, but those of us who continue to keep up the pace go on to finish AP Calculus BC and AP Statistics by the end of junior year. As a result, each senior class ends up with a handful of students who have a great affinity for math, but no more math classes that provide a challenge (or AP credit, for that matter). So, the ATTAM class was created by, and is practically exclusive to, those students who crave more advanced math knowledge. Students like myself who get this far are able to get a head start on topics usually only available at universities, such as linear algebra, advanced logic and proofs, and vector and matrix applications. It may not have an AP credit to back it up, but those of us in the class know it doesn't need one to be valuable.

	Just as I'd hoped, I've progressed from Semi-Finalist to Finalist status and been deemed eligible to receive a National Merit Scholarship.

	At the beginning of the second semester, I found out something new: I'm fresh out of AP courses! AP Psychology only lasted for the first semester, and when I looked over the list of available courses with school counsellors, we found out that there were simply no more APs left which I could take. Furthermore, all the available pre-AP courses were for subjects in which I'd skipped straight to the AP version. I worked it out with Mr. Newton (the main math teacher who wrote one of my letters of recommendation), who agreed to take me on as a teacher's aide. This should be a great opportunity to reinforce the college-level mathematics I'm currently learning from him in ATTAM.
  </li>
  <li>
	It has come to my attention that some of the higher universities I've applied to have found the B averages in some of my 9th and 10th grade math classes to be somewhat lacking by their standards. While I understand the concern about what that could potentially mean about my future performance, many colleges are unable to take into account the circumstances which caused this. As I've said before, the rate at which we tackle math courses at SEM is significantly greater than at most schools, especially for those in Super Fast Track. Needless to say, this took some getting used to; prior to my enrolment at SEM, my aptitude in math and science made organization methods practically unnecessary, but going from a single algebra course in 8th grade to three different math courses all at once suddenly made this a necessity, and the near-vertical learning curve this provided took me a while to get a hang of. With the sudden increase in workload and hardly any framework for organization in those first couple years, the issue wasn't even the difficulty of the work; it was the fact that I wasn't good enough at organization to remember all my homework assignments, which routinely pulled down my grades although in-class tests and the AP tests I took showed that I had a firm grasp of the material. Thankfully, as you can see by my more recent grades, I managed to gradually correct these organization issues, and by the end of the next school year, I finally had learned enough about my own behavior to keep myself from losing track of any more assignments.
  </li>

	The AP exams for this year are just around the corner, and I'm feeling pretty confident this year; my main concern was the English Literature AP due to my dysgraphia (which tends to lower my essay grades simply because I don't have time to finish), but I've managed to speed up with practice. With any luck, U.S. History should remain as the only AP which I've scored any less than a 4 on.
